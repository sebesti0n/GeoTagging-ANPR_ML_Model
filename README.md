# GeoTagging- CCTV Feed Analysis - License Plate Recognition ML Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a geotagging application that utilizes Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) to analyze CCTV camera feeds and extract license plate numbers. The application uses EasyOCR for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Ultralytics for object detection, and a custom machine learning model trained in a Jupyter notebook.

## Features

- License Plate Recognition using ANPR
- Object detection using Ultralytics
- Flask backend to create API endpoints
- Integration with MongoDB to store analysis results

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask
- MongoDB
- Other dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)
